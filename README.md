# TeaSharp

TeaSharp is a _begginer-friendly_ programming language, which is very connected to **_the culture of 80s and 90s_**.

## Easiness

TeaSharp's syntax is very _easy and clean_, which makes it very _begginer-frendly_.

1. TeaSharp doesn't uses `"` symbols for strings;
2. It also doesn't uses brackets for functions and other things.
3. TeaSharp uses simple keywords like `from` instead of `for`.
4. TeaSharp has some more special keywords like `do` or `as` for simplicity (which you might think makes the programming language harder, but it actually makes it better to understand)

## Installation

```sh

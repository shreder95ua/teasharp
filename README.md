# TeaSharp
TeaSharp is a *begginer-friendly* programming language, which is very connected to ***the culture of 80s and 90s***.
## Easiness
TeaSharp's syntax is very *easy and clean*, which makes it very *begginer-frendly*.
1. TeaSharp doesn't uses `"` symbols for strings;
2. It also doesn't uses brackets for functions and other things.
3. TeaSharp uses simple keywords like `from` instead of `for`.
4. TeaSharp has some more special keywords like `do` or `as` for simplicity (which you might think makes the programming language harder, but it actually makes it better to understand)
### Example:
#### TeaSharp:
> `Print Hello World!`
#### Python:
> `print("Hello World!")`
